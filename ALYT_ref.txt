-----------------ALYT (Archived LaYouT?) file format documentation-----------------
Written by Tyulis. I have found all informations descripted here

All values are little endian

First, an ALYT Header:
	Offset (relative) | Size (in bytes) | Description
	-------------------------------------------------
	0x00              | 4               | Magic string (Always "ALYT")
	0x04              | 4               | Undetermined (seems to be always 0x02000400)
	0x08              | 4               | ALYT header length (0x28)
	0x0C              | 4               | LTBL section's length
	0x10              | 4               | End offset of LTBL section
	0x14              | 4               | LMTL section's length
	0x18              | 4               | End offset of LMTL section
	0x1C              | 4               | LFNL section's length
	0x20              | 4               | End offset of LFNL section
	0x24              | 4               | file length (from the end of LFNL section)

Then, 3 sections named LTBL, LMTL and LFNL, with a similar header:
	Offset (relative) | Size (in bytes)      | Description
	-------------------------------------------------
	0x00              | 4                    | Magic (name of the section)
	0x04              | 2                    | Unknown
	0x06              | 2                    | Appears to be the number of BFLYT files in the archive

A file names table. Purpose undetermined
Entries are ASCII file names, without folder, and padded with null bytes to fill 64 bytes

A string table, seems to be symbols (these strings can be found in the contained BFLYT and BFLAN file)
Entries are ASCII strings, and padded with null bytes to fill 32 bytes

Then, there is a variable padding, and a standard SARC section, which contains files. You can find a full documentation on SARC format on http://3dbrew.org/wiki/SARC
In this section, all offsets are relative to the start of the SARC section
