-----------------ALYT (Archived LaYouT?) file format documentation-----------------
Written by Tyulis. I found all informations descripted here

All values are little endian

First, an ALYT Header:
	Offset (relative) | Size (in bytes) | Description
	-------------------------------------------------
	0x00              | 4               | Magic string (Always "ALYT")
	0x04              | 4               | Undetermined (appears to be always 0x02000400)
	0x08              | 4               | ALYT header length (0x28)
	0x0C              | 4               | LTBL section's length
	0x10              | 4               | End offset of LTBL section
	0x14              | 4               | LMTL section's length
	0x18              | 4               | End offset of LMTL section
	0x1C              | 4               | LFNL section's length
	0x20              | 4               | End offset of LFNL section
	0x24              | 4               | file length (from the end of LFNL section)

Then, 3 sections named LTBL, LMTL and LFNL, with a similar header:
	Offset (relative) | Size (in bytes)      | Description
	-------------------------------------------------
	0x00              | 4                    | Magic (name of the section)
	0x04              | 2                    | Unknown. Always 0.
	0x06              | 2                    | Number of entries. 1 entry/BFLYT file contained
	0x08              | 4/entry              | Offset table. Offset of the entries, relative to the section beginning

The data contained is obviously different.

LTBL:

 Each entry has this structure:
	2B: Offset of the bflyt file in the name table (4=the 4th name in the table, from the beginning)
	2B: Number of prt1 sections in the BFLYT
	4B: Number of anims
	4B: prt1 names offsets table offset
	4B: links (?) offsets table offset
	4B: anims names offsets table offset
	These 3 offsets are relative to the beginning of the entry, and are 0 if the table contains no entries
	prt1 sections names in the BFLYT file indexes in the symbol table (2B/offset). Aligned to 4 Bytes
	Links? same number as prt1 names offsets and also 2B/entry. Indexes of some BFLYT files in the file name table. Aligned to 4 Bytes
	Anims file names offsets (exactly like the BFLYT offset, but in 4B) (4B/offset). Aligned to 4 Bytes

LMTL:

Each entry has this structure:
	2B: Offset of the bflyt file in the name table (4=the 4th name in the table, from the beginning)
	2B: blocks number? Appears to be always 0 or 1
	Then blocks:
		4B: length of the block (in bytes)
		Data

LFNL:

Each entry has this structure:
	2B: offset 
	2B: subentry count
	Entries. 2B/entry. Unknown
The offsets are entry numbers of BFLYT file names in the file name table (4=the 4th name in the table, from the beginning)


A file names table.
Entries are ASCII file names, without folder, and padded with null bytes to fill 64 bytes

A symbol table (these strings are notably materials, panes and groups names in BFLYT files)
Entries are ASCII strings, and padded with null bytes to fill 32 bytes

Then, there is a variable padding, and a standard SARC section, which contains files. You can find a full documentation on SARC format on http://3dbrew.org/wiki/SARC
In this section, all offsets are relative to the start of the SARC section
