------------------------BL archive format description------------------------

This is a description of the structure of the BL (?) archive file format.
I found these files in the Pok√©mon Sun and Moon games files, and I named it because of their magic number "BL".
These files are very simple archives, without file names support.

Header:
	Offset            | Size (in bytes) | Description
	-------------------------------------------------
	0x00              | 2               | Magic string (Always "BL")
	0x02              | 2               | Number of files

Then an offset table, where each entry is a 4 bytes offset from the start of the file. Each offset is the start offset of a file.
The last offset is the BL file's end.

The block header+table is padded to 0x80 bytes

Then, directly the files data. Each file is 0x80 bytes aligned
