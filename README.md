# ALYTtool
A tool to extract and repack ALYT files used in Pok√©mon games to store UI data and images

It also support transparently BL archives, which contain several ALYT and other files.

Usage:

*	to extract an ALYT or BL file:

		python3 ALYTtool.py -x <file name>

*	to repack a previously extracted ALYT or BL file (extracted with ALYTtool):
		
		python3 ALYTtool.py -p <folder name>

A little documentation about ALYT file format can be found in the ALYT_ref.txt file

A full description of BL format can be found in the BL_ref.txt file

A list of the files in the RomFS and their description (when I have found it) can be found in the files.txt file.

Each entry is of the form:

	<path in the romfs>: <file name in the extracted GARC (or all)>: <content description>

To convert between BFLIM and PNG, you can use the included scripts. You will need OpenCV. To get it, run:

	pip3 install opencv-python

BFLIM to PNG:

	python3 bflim.py -x <bflim file>

PNG to BFLIM:

	python3 bflim.py -s <swizzling> -c <PNG input file> <BFLIM output file>

To get the original swizzling of the image, look at the console output if you used bflim.py to convert it, swizzling is the "Swizzle" value (normally 4 or 8). If you converted using the following scripts, search your file name in the generated \_extract.log, swizzling is also the 4 or 8 after "Swizzle" value

To convert all BFLIM files contained in an extracted ALYT file to PNG:

	python3 alyt-bflim.py <extracted ALYT folder name>

To convert all BFLIM files contained in an extracted BL file to PNG:

	python3 bl-bflim.py <extracted BL folder name>

To convert all BFLIM files contained in a folder:

	python3 folder-bflim.py <folder>

bflim.py is a slightly modified version of the [ObsidianX's original](http://www.github.com/ObsidianX/3dstools) to support python3, with various minor changes.
