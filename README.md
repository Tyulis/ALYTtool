# ALYTtool
A tool to extract and repack ALYT files used in Pok√©mon games to store UI data and images

It also support transparently BL archives, which contain several ALYT and other files.

Usage:

*	to extract an ALYT or BL file:

		python3 ALYTtool.py -x <file name>

*	to repack a previously extracted ALYT or BL file (extracted with ALYTtool):
		
		python3 ALYTtool.py -p <folder name>

A little documentation about ALYT file format can be found in the ALYT_ref.txt file

A full description of BL format can be found in the BL_ref.txt file

A list of the files in the RomFS and their description (when I have found it) can be found in the files.txt file.

Each entry is of the form:

	<path in the romfs>: <file name in the extracted GARC (or all)>: <content description>

You can convert between BFLIM and PNG using [ObsidianX's 3dstools](https://www.github.com/ObsidianX/3dstools) (needs Python 2.7, [PyPNG](https://github.com/drj11/pypng), OpenCV for swizzling)
